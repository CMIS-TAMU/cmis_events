# ✅ No Domain Needed - Here's What to Do Instead!

## 🎯 **You've Already Done the Hard Part!**

You've added `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev` to your `.env.local` - that's perfect! ✅

---

## ❌ **DON'T Add a Domain**

**Skip the "Add Domain" screen entirely!** 

You don't need it because:
- ✅ `onboarding@resend.dev` is already verified by Resend
- ✅ It works immediately - no setup needed
- ✅ No DNS records required

---

## ✅ **DO THIS INSTEAD - Verify Recipients**

### **Step 1: Go to "Emails" Section**

In the Resend dashboard:
1. Click on **"Emails"** in the left sidebar (instead of "Domains")
2. OR go directly to: https://resend.com/emails

### **Step 2: Find "Verified Recipients"**

Look for:
- **"Settings"** → **"Verified Recipients"**
- OR **"Audience"** → **"Verified Recipients"**
- OR a button that says **"Add Recipient"** or **"Verify Email"**

### **Step 3: Add Your Recipient Emails**

Click **"Add Recipient"** and add these emails:
- `prasanna.salunkhe@tamu.edu`
- `nisarg.sonar@tamu.edu`

**Note:** The test domain can only send to emails you've verified in Resend.

---

## 🚀 **Then Restart Your Server**

1. Stop server: `Ctrl+C`
2. Start server: `npm run dev`
3. Create a test event
4. Emails will work! ✅
