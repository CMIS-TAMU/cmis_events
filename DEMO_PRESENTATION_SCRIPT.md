## 🎬 SCRIPT START

### **SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION** (1 minute)

**Opening:**

>
> In the next 15 minutes, I'll walk you through the challenges we've been facing, how our new system solves them, and give you a live demonstration of the key features.

### **SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM** (4-5 minutes)

#### **Problem 1: Manual Event Management** (1.5 min)

**Talk:**
> "Let me paint a picture of what event management looked like before:

**Pain Points:**
- ❌ **Manual Registration Process**
  - Students had to email coordinators
  - Excel spreadsheets were manually maintained
  - Capacity tracking was error-prone
  - No real-time visibility into attendance

- ❌ **Time-Consuming Coordination**
  - Graduate assistants spent 20+ hours per event
  - Manual email confirmations
  - No automated waitlist management
  - Last-minute cancellations caused chaos

- ❌ **Limited Scalability**
  - Couldn't handle multiple events simultaneously
  - No self-service capabilities
  - Everything required admin intervention

**Impact:**
> "This meant we could only run a few events per semester, and our team was constantly overwhelmed. Students missed opportunities because the registration process was too cumbersome."

**[PAUSE 2 seconds]**

---

#### **Problem 2: Disconnected Student-Sponsor Interaction** (1.5 min)

**Talk:**
> "The second major challenge was connecting students with sponsors:

**Pain Points:**
- ❌ **No Resume Sharing System**
  - Resumes sent via email chains
  - Sponsors couldn't search for candidates
  - No organized way to track student interests
  - Missed networking opportunities

- ❌ **Manual Matching Process**
  - No automated student-sponsor matching
  - Missed connections between compatible interests
  - No way to track engagement
  - Limited sponsor visibility into student pool

- ❌ **Inefficient Communication**
  - Email overload
  - No centralized communication hub
  - Difficult to track interactions

**Impact:**
> "This meant sponsors struggled to find the right students, and students missed out on career opportunities. The networking aspect of our events wasn't reaching its full potential."

**[PAUSE 2 seconds]**

---

#### **Problem 3: Lack of Intelligent Mentorship System** (1 min)

**Talk:**
> "Third, we had no structured way to connect students with mentors:

**Pain Points:**
- ❌ **No Matching Algorithm**
  - Manual mentor-student pairing
  - Based on limited criteria
  - Time-consuming for coordinators
  - No way to track mentorship success

- ❌ **Limited Mentor Engagement**
  - Mentors weren't actively engaged
  - Students struggled to find mentors
  - No short-term mentorship options
  - Missing mentorship tracking

- ❌ **No Feedback Loop**
  - No way to measure mentorship effectiveness
  - Limited visibility into mentorship relationships
  - No data-driven improvements

**Impact:**
> "This meant mentorship opportunities were underutilized, and students weren't getting the guidance they needed to succeed."

**[PAUSE 2 seconds]**

---

#### **Problem 4: Inefficient Check-in & Analytics** (30 sec)

**Talk:**
> "Finally, we lacked real-time insights:

**Pain Points:**
- ❌ Paper-based check-in at events
- ❌ No real-time attendance tracking
- ❌ Limited analytics and reporting
- ❌ No way to measure event success

**Impact:**
> "We were flying blind. We couldn't make data-driven decisions about future events or demonstrate value to stakeholders."

**[PAUSE 2 seconds]**

**Transition:**
> "So that's the problem. Now, let me show you how we solved it."

---

> - Upcoming events they're registered for
> - Events they might be interested in

**[ACTION: Click on an event]**

> "When they browse events, they can see all the details - date, time, location, capacity. Let me register for this event."

**[ACTION: Click "Register for Event"]**

> "The registration is instant. They immediately receive:
> - A confirmation email
> - A QR code for check-in
> - Event details in their calendar

#### **DEMO 2: Intelligent Mentor Matching** (2 min)
