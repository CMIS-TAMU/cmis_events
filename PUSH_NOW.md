# Push Your Code Now! 🚀

## Run This Command in Your Terminal

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
cd /Users/abhishekpatil/Documents/Projects/CMIS-Cursor
git push -u origin main
```

## When Prompted:

1. **Username:** Enter your GitHub username
2. **Password:** Paste your Personal Access Token (NOT your GitHub password!)

The token starts with `ghp_` - paste the entire thing.

---

## Alternative: Push with Token in URL (One-time)

If you prefer, you can push directly with the token in the URL (only use this once, then we'll configure it properly):

```bash
cd /Users/abhishekpatil/Documents/Projects/CMIS-Cursor

# Replace YOUR_TOKEN with your actual token
git push https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/CMIS-TAMU/cmis_events.git main
```

---

## After Successful Push

Once the push succeeds, verify by visiting:
https://github.com/CMIS-TAMU/cmis_events

You should see all your documentation files! 🎉
